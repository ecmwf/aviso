# Aviso Rest

This component is a REST frontend that allows notification providers to submit notifications to the Aviso service 
via REST. Internally it uses Aviso as if it was a client towards the Aviso Service.

Build it using the Dockerfile in the upper directory. It is there because it needs the context to have Aviso as well.
