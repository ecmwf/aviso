# Aviso

Aviso is a service developed at ECMWF with the aim of notifying for **data availability** of the time-critical data
produced at ECMWF, such as the real-time forecast and derived products.

It allows users to:

* Define which events to be notified of.
* Define the triggers to be executed once a notification is received.

This enables the creation of automatic workflows timely triggered as data become available
 

The documentation can be found at https://aviso.readthedocs.io/.
