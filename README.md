# Aviso

Aviso is a notification application developed in Python. It allows users to:
* Define the events for which being notified.
* Define the triggers to be executed once a notification is received.
* Dispatch notifications to the notification server.

Moreover, Aviso can also be used to store and retrieve configuration files for various distributed services. In this 
case it acts as a configuration client application. 

These two functionalities, notification and configuration, share the same server technology and architecture, and 
therefore most of the user options. 
This page gives a quick introduction on the notification functionality only. 

For a detailed description of the notification functionality and of the configuration client application please 
refer to the [user manual](user_manual.md).

For information regarding the installation please refer to the [installation guide](install.md).

For information on how to contribute to the development and to the architectural design please refer to the [development
